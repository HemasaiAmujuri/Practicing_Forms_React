📝 Practicing Forms in React
After completing a React course, I started practicing building forms using the following concepts:

useState and useEffect

Controlled and uncontrolled components

useForm (e.g., from React Hook Form)

Integration with third-party APIs

This project is a hands-on practice to strengthen my understanding of form handling in React.
