üìù Practicing Forms in React
After completing a React course, I started practicing building forms using the following concepts:

This project is a hands-on practice to strengthen my understanding of form handling in React.

1.controlled components
  "I have successfully created forms using controlled components in React, where the form data is managed by the component's state (using useState). Additionally, I have completed learning the React Router concepts and implemented routing in my application."

  Explanation:
    Controlled Components:
         In React, controlled components are components where the form data is controlled by React state. That means every form input (like <input>, <textarea>, <select>, etc.) has its            value bound to a state, and when the user types, the state gets updated.
    React Routing:
        React Router is a powerful library used for routing in React apps, enabling navigation between different views or pages in a single-page application (SPA).
